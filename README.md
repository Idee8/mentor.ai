## About the Project

Mentor AI is an AI-powered coding mentor that helps developers analyze, understand, and improve their code. It provides intelligent insights, best practices, and learning recommendations, making it an invaluable tool for both beginners and experienced engineers.

### Why Mentor AI?

Software development is complex, and traditional documentation often falls short. Developers need **real-time**, **context-aware** guidance while coding. Mentor AI bridges this gap by offering:
- **Code analysis** to detect issues and suggest improvements
- **In-depth explanations** of complex logic and patterns
- **Best practices** to help you write cleaner, maintainable code
- **Personalized learning paths** to level up your skills faster
