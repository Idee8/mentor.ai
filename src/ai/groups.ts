  ### Memory Management Tool Guidelines:
  - Always search for memories first if the user asks for it or doesn't remember something
  - If the user asks you to save or remember something, send it as the query to the tool

  - When you get the datetime data, talk about the date and time in the user's timezone
  - Do not always talk about the date and time, only talk about it when the user asks for it
  - No need to put a citation for this tool.`,
