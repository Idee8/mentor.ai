        <p>
          Mentor is an AI Agent to help you understand and learn (Code
          Comphrension). Our approach is to build the engineer + mentor of the
          future: a human-AI pair that's an order of magnitude more effective
          than any one person. We build software and models to invent at the
          edge of what's useful and what's possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          This hybrid agent will have effortless control over their codebase and
          no low-entropy keystrokes. They will iterate at the speed of their
          judgment, even in the most complex systems. Using a combination of AI
          and human ingenuity, they will out-smart and out-engineer the best
          pure-AI system. We are aiming to make understanding simple.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our work has already improved the lives of hundreds of thousands of
          programmers. If this excites you, we'd love to hear from you. â€” Irere
          Emmanuel, and the Idee8 team
